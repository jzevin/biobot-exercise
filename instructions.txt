Objective
Using JavaScript and React, your assignment is to create a Search for Kits functionality.

Recommended time
3 hours

Brief
Biobot customers receive a kit with tubes inside of it, which the customer uses to collect
samples, and later sends the kit back to the Biobot lab. Your task is to build out search with an
autocomplete functionality for our customers to use to track the shipping status of that kit. Each
kit has a label on it with a unique kit identifier and FedEx tracking number. (See attached JSON
file for the data)
Tasks

● Create an endpoint that returns kits.
● Create a UI component that a user is able to type in the kit id and have information
returned about it.
○ Feel free to use Create React App
○ There are 1,000 kits in our current database, but it keeps growing every day so
build it for scale

Notes
● Create a Github repository to turn this in
